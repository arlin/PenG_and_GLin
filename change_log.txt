## Sept 29.  initial version 

The initial version of the github data was based on a zipped archive pulled from Dryad: 

  http://datadryad.org/review?wfID=13640&token=00ab3e23-0601-4320-a7a0-29fa40589d6a
  
It had been submitted there as part of an earlier SSB submission of the manuscript.  

Arlin took this archive and made a number of changes to the naming of files to make it more intelligble.  These changes are described in "initial_renaming_of_files.txt"
