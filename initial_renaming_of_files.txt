## file renaming for purposes of archiving 

We changed the names of methods, and used a somewhat irregular system while developing results.  Changing the names required several hours of interactive scripting. 

The aim was to keep the name structure from before (see below), but regularize the formatting by putting underscores between elements, and normalize the codes 

<shape> ::= pec | int | sym
<rep> ::= 1..1000
<dens> ::= f4 | f10 | f25
<method> ::= ad11 | m08 | m08min | obs | glin | peng 

Steps: 

* manually fixing 3 files that somehow didn't fit the patterns 
** mv z1__f10__ad11_uncal.tre z_int_1_f10_ad11_uncal.tre
** mv z2__f25__ad11_uncal.tre z_int_2_f25_ad11_uncal.tre
** mv z4__f4.ndornuncal.tre z_int_4_f4_ad11_uncal.tre
* recoding those files that start with z and have a single letter for tree shape 
* changing all the method names 
* added underscore or period after dens as needed
* changed dens_num to dens 
* changed DENS to dens (f4,.. instead of F4,..)
* fixed shape at the levels 1, 2, 3 and 4 to remove 8tax_ prefix
* changed DENS to dens (f4,.. instead of F4,..)

## summary of pre-archiving structure 

top level - the 3 tree shapes (8tax_int, 8tax_sym 8tax_pec) and the dornburg comparison, which has the full dornburg, to be compared with what?  the first replicate of each tree shape?  

for the 3 tree shapes, the 2nd level has the 1000 replicates for each shape: <shape>/<shape>_<N> where N is 1 to 1000 

and the 3rd level, has the base data for this case, and the directories for each fossil density 

* <N>ultra.tre
* 8tax_sym_<N>.tre
* 8tax_sym_<N>branches.txt
* 8tax_sym_<N>nodes.txt
* 8tax_sym_<N>uncal.txt
* F4/
* F10/
* F25/

4th level - results at a fossil density for the different methods.  Here is an example:

The files with bit-coded names must represent splits used to identify the clade on which to assign the simulated fossil dates in the file, because there are always 14, which is the number of branches that may have fossils, and some of the files are empty (indicating no fossil).  

The names are encoded so that each name is unique, identifying its shape, replicate, fossil density and method.  Here are the codes: 

<shape> ::= 8tax_pec | 8tax_int | 8tax_sym
<s> ::= p | i | s 
<rep> ::= 1..1000
<DENS> ::= F4 | F10 | F25
<dens> ::= f4 | f10 | f25
<dens_num> ::= 4 | 10 | 25 
<method> ::= dorn | marsh | m2arsh | obs | hfd | p 
<bitcodes> ::= [01]{8}

based on that, most of the directories have a structure like: 

./<shape>_<rep>/
	<rep>ultra.tre
	<shape>_<rep>.tree
	<shape>_<rep>branches.txt
	<shape>_<rep>nodes.txt
	<shape>_<rep>uncal.txt
	<DENS>/
		<bitcodes>
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.anc_tree
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.ma
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.root
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.scale_tree
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.seq
    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>.trace
    	
I find that 

    	<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>uncal.xml
    	
is in 100 of the int replicates, but 1000 of the pec and sym replicates.  That seems odd. 

The following references to methods are in 15 directories (5 each of sym, pec, int): 

		<rep><s><dens><method>.tre
		<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num><method>.txt
		<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num><method>.xml
		<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num><method>comp.txt

and some of the "comp" files have comp1 or comp2.  But there are also some variants beyond this 

./<shape>_<rep>/<DENS>/<shape>_<rep>_<dens_num>dornuncal.xml
./<shape>_<rep>/<DENS>/z<rep><s><dens>dornuncal.tre

where prefix z is followed by replicate number, then a single-letter-code for tree shape (p, i, s), then fossil density, method, and "uncal", where the method is always "dorn".  

In the pectinate subdirectory only, replicate 4 (only) has files with "comb2" instead of "comp2".  That sounds like an error.
